;Suppose ax = 20 , write an assembly language program to increment ax value by 1


;will increase the value of ax register by 1
; first 20 will be converted to hex value then increment will take place
; 20d = 14h
mov ax,20
inc ax



;Suppose ax = 20 , write an assembly language program to increment ax value by 1 5 times
mov ax,20
inc ax
